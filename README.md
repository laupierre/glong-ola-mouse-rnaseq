# GLONG and OLA mouse RNA-seq (220120_A00558_0160_AH5V77DSX3)

OLA mice are KO for synuclein....they must have no expression of synuclein  
GLONG mice are over-expressing truncated human alpha synuclein in the OLA background 

This is the analysis of the GLONG vs OLA mouse at 3 months, 6 months and 15 months  
The raw counts were obtained with the IIT RNA-Seq pipeline (see github RNA-Seq_mouse repository)  
The rnaseq_mouse_v0.0.2.sh was used for the RNA-Seq analysis
